In a conventional design, 10 to 12 volts are applied to a tub, a source, and a drain during a tub erase, and -6 V is applied to a control gate of a flash memory device. However, in the conventional CMOS process, it is difficult to construct high voltage devices for supporting 6 volts or more source / drain voltage unless the complexity of the process is not significantly increased. As such, as the HV devices are required, the tub erase is not widely used for the insertion application.

999	[MASK] : Method of manufacturing plastic roofing materials with coating layer formed [SEP] As relating to a method for producing a plastic roof material having a coating layer, a moisture penetration to a paint applied to the surface of the roofing material is prevented, and the durability of the paint is improved, and the durability of the paint is prevented, and the durability of the external environment such as ultraviolet rays And for the purpose of making it. Roof re-cooling process for cooling roof material produced by molding process by mold by mold, roof re-cooling process for cooling the roof material manufactured through the process, the roof re-cleaning process, which cleans the surface of the cooled roofing material The moisture of the cleaned roofing material is evaporated and the moisture is removed by a flame of 350 to 450 ° C so that the surface of the surface is heated by a flame of 350 to 450 ° C, The Molded Painted Painting Process and Molded Paints applied to the paint is made of a heat-curing process that heated the roofing material. Therefore, by a flame of 350 to 450 ° C, the roofing material is heated by a flame of 350 to 450 ° C after the surface of the surface moisture of the roofing material produced through the roof reception surface heating process, Moisture permeability to the surface applied to the surface is prevented and the durability of the paint is improved and the discoloration is prevented, and it has the effect of improving the durability to the external environment such as the roofing material. [SEP] In a method for producing plastic roofing materials, a roof re-cleaning process for cleaning a roof material produced by a dolling process and a roof material cooling through a roofing process by a mold and a roof re-cooling process, Process, Roof Re-confinement by cleaning process The surface moisture of the cleaned roofing material is evaporated and to have adhesive affinity to the surface to be flexibly to be flexibly to the surface of 350 ~ 450 ℃, The molars of the molars to be removed and the molars of the mohmine, which apply to the surface of the roofing material, and the roofing material coated with the Moldain Paint is accumulated in the roof re-surface heating process, The roof material of the molded process is performed on a support frame, and the roof reforming process of cutting the side protrusions of the molding process formed in the roofing material is further performed; The roof material molding process is added The plastic material is used to prepare a plastic material, and the plastic material is produced by adding ceramic or fly ash to increase durability, and the Moldin Paint is mixed with a weight ratio of 1: 2 to a weight ratio of 1: 2; A coating removal cleaning process is made on a surface heating process and a carbide removal cleaning process, which can be removed by a brush, which can remove carbide carbide by a flame, method.	22229
